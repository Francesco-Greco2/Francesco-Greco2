Hi there! 👋 I'm Francesco, a data enthusiast with a diverse background in customer service and a growing passion for data and analytics over the past two years.

Almost 2 years ago, I transitioned into a Junior Data Analyst role and am on the path to becoming a Certified Level 4 Data Analyst. ✨

I enjoy diving into data using tools like Excel, PowerQuery, AWS Quicksight, R, and PowerBI. 📊
My skills in SQL, R, and PowerBI have been honed through a Level 4 Data Analyst apprenticeship, and I'm always eager to learn more. 🤗

When I'm not working with data, you can find me coding, keeping up with the latest tech trends, playing on my PS5 🎮, or watching sci-fi TV series 📺. 

I also love walking in the park 🚶‍♂️‍➡️ 🏞️ and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen 👨‍🍳.

Let's connect and share our data and tech adventures! 🚀
