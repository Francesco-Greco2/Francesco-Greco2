Hi there! I'm Francesco, a data enthusiast with a diverse background in customer service and a growing passion for data and analytics over the past two years.

Recently, I transitioned into a Junior Data Analyst role and am on the path to becoming a Level 4 Data Analyst.

I enjoy diving into data using tools like Excel, PowerQuery, AWS Quicksight, R, and PowerBI. 
My skills in SQL, R, and PowerBI have been honed through a Level 4 Data Analyst apprenticeship, and I'm always eager to learn more.

When I'm not working with data, you can find me coding, keeping up with the latest tech trends, playing on my PS5, or watching sci-fi TV series. 
I also love walking in the park and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

Let's connect and share our data and tech adventures!
